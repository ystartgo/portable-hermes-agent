# Portable Hermes Agent

**Portable AI agent desktop for Windows** — 100 tools, GUI, local models via LM Studio, TTS, Music, ComfyUI, workflows, tool maker. No install. No Docker. No admin rights.

Built on [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) (MIT License) with extensive customization for non-technical users.

---

## Features

### Desktop GUI
- Dark-themed Tkinter interface with chat, sidebar, and session management
- Multi-language UI support with real-time switching: Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), Simplified Chinese (簡體中文), and English
- Image attachment with thumbnails (vision model support)
- Guided mode — works even without an AI model connected
- API key setup wizard with individual service configuration
- Permissions panel with granular control over file, network, and system access

### 100 Tools Across 20+ Toolsets

| Toolset | Tools | What It Does |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **LM Studio** | 10 | Load/unload models, search HuggingFace, tokenize, embed, direct chat |
| **Music** | 7 | Generate music, manage models, GPU workers, output library |
| **TTS** | 7 | Text-to-speech, 10 voice models, voice cloning, job management |
| **ComfyUI** | 7 | Image generation, instance management, model/node browsing |
| **Workflows** | 6 | Create, run, schedule, and manage multi-step automation pipelines |
| **Tool Maker** | 3 | Dynamically create API wrapper or Python handler tools at runtime |
| **Serper** | 1 | Google-quality search via Serper.dev API |
| **Guide** | 1 | Searchable built-in user manual |
| **GPU** | 1 | NVIDIA GPU status (memory, temp, utilization) |
| **Model Switcher** | 1 | Switch between cloud and local AI models |
| **Hermes Update** | 2 | Update upstream Hermes while preserving portable tools, extensions, and runtime data |

Plus all built-in hermes-agent tools: web search, file operations, browser automation, code execution, delegation, memory, skills, messaging, Home Assistant, and more.

### Extension Modules

Three portable AI generation servers from [aivrar](https://github.com/aivrar):

| Extension | Port | Models | GPU |
|-----------|------|--------|-----|
| **[TTS Server](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-tts-server)** | 8200 | Kokoro, XTTS, Dia, Bark, Fish, + 5 more | 4 GB+ |
| **[Music Server](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-music-server)** | 9150 | MusicGen, Stable Audio, ACE-Step, Riffusion | 4 GB+ |
| **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/aivrar/comfyui-portable-installer)** | 5000 | SD 1.5, SDXL, Flux, 100+ registry models | 6 GB+ |

Each extension auto-installs on first use. No system dependencies.

### Workflow Engine
Chain tool calls into automated pipelines with data flow, conditions, loops, parallel execution, error handling, and cron scheduling.

### Dynamic Tool Maker
Create new tools at runtime — wrap any REST API or write custom Python handlers. Tools persist across sessions and reload automatically.

### Guided Mode
No API key? No problem. The chat works offline using a built-in 1,054-line user guide. New users get step-by-step guidance to set up their first AI model.

## Quick Start

### 1. Download
Download the latest `portable-hermes-agent-v*.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-hermes-agent/releases/latest), then extract it to a normal folder.

Recommended:
```text
C:\Users\YourName\Portable-Hermes-Agent
```

Avoid protected folders such as `C:\Program Files`.

### 2. Start
Double-click:
```batch
START.bat
```

On first launch, `START.bat` runs the portable setup automatically. It downloads embedded Python, dependencies, LM Studio SDK, and Node.js tools into this folder only. No admin rights are needed.

Manual setup:
```batch
install.bat
```

PowerShell users can run:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

### 3. Launch Again
```batch
START.bat           :: easiest GUI launch
UPDATE.bat          :: safest one-click update
hermes_gui.bat      :: GUI mode
hermes.bat          :: CLI mode
```

### Updating

Portable Hermes has **two independent update channels**. Updating one does not automatically update the other.

| Update channel | What it updates | How to run it |
|---|---|---|
| **Portable Hermes distribution** | The Windows launchers, integrations, portable tools, and the Hermes version tested with this repository | Close Hermes, then double-click `UPDATE.bat` |
| **Upstream Hermes Agent** | Newer core agent code from `NousResearch/hermes-agent` | Start Hermes and ask it to check or run its upstream updater |

For the normal, safest maintenance path, close other Hermes windows and gateways, then double-click:

```batch
UPDATE.bat
```

Or run:

```batch
hermes.bat update --backup --yes
```

This updates from `aivrar/portable-hermes-agent`, makes a backup when requested, and preserves runtime folders such as `.hermes/`, `.hermes/custom_tools/`, `.hermes/extensions/`, `extensions/`, and `python_embedded/`. The portable Node.js runtime is stored under `HERMES_HOME/node/`, so it also survives both update types without modifying a system Node installation.

If you also want newer upstream Hermes code, start Hermes after the Portable update and ask:

> Check whether upstream Hermes Agent has updates. Do not install anything yet.

Then, if you want the available update, ask:

> Update upstream Hermes Agent while preserving Portable Hermes. When finished, tell me whether I should restart.

Restart Hermes after a successful upstream update so the running process loads the new Python modules. A Git checkout can report an exact ahead/behind count; a release ZIP has no Git history, so it reports ZIP-overlay mode instead and can still install the latest upstream code.

Most users do not need daily updates. Run the Portable updater when a release, fix, or security notice is published (or every week or two), and check upstream weekly if you want newer Hermes features. Checking daily is optional.

See **[Keeping Portable Hermes Updated](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-hermes-agent/wiki/Keeping-Portable-Hermes-Updated)** for the complete workflow, backups, release-ZIP behavior, and troubleshooting.

### 4. Connect an AI Model

**Cloud (2 minutes, free):**
1. File > API Key Setup > OpenRouter
2. Sign up at openrouter.ai (free, no credit card)
3. Paste your API key
4. Start chatting

**Local (needs NVIDIA GPU):**
1. Download [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Download a model, start the server
3. Tools > LM Studio in the GUI
4. Load model, click "Use for Chat"

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Internet connection (for cloud AI) or NVIDIA GPU 8GB+ (for local AI)
- No admin rights, no system Python, no Docker

---

## Documentation

A searchable user guide is built into the agent — ask it anything or use the `search_guide` tool. The [PDF manual](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-hermes-agent/releases/latest) is included in every release.

Key topics: getting started, API setup, the interface, permissions, LM Studio local models, extensions (TTS/Music/ComfyUI), all 100 tools, custom tool creation, workflows, and a glossary of AI terms.
